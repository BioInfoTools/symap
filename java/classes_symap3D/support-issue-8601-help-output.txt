Starts the MySQL database server

Usage: /opt/AcmeAB/APPX/jetty-5.1.3/mysql/bin/mysqld [OPTIONS]

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /usr/local/mysql/data/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-4.1
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any options file
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read

                      down or the connection is lost.
  --master-host=name  Master hostname or IP address for replication. If not
                      set, the slave thread will not be started. Note that the
                      setting of master-host will be ignored if there exists a
                      valid master.info file.
  --master-info-file=name 
                      The location and name of the file that remembers the

                      The password the slave thread will authenticate with when
                      connecting to the master. If not set, an empty password
                      is assumed.The value in master.info will take precedence
                      if it can be read.
  --master-port=#     The port the master is listening on. If not set, the
                      compiled setting of MYSQL_PORT is assumed. If you have
                      not tinkered with configure options, this should be 3306.
                      The value in master.info will take precedence if it can
                      be read.
  --master-retry-count=# 
                      The number of tries the slave will make to connect to the
                      master before giving up.

                      assumed. The value in master.info will take precedence if
                      it can be read.
  --max-binlog-dump-events=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --memlock           Lock mysqld in memory.

  --relay-log-info-file=name 
                      The location and name of the file that remembers where
                      the SQL replication thread is in the relay logs.
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-datbase updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to to the
                      master during slave registration. Will appear in the
                      output of SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not
                      want the slave to register itself with the master. Note
                      that it is not sufficient for the master to simply read
                      the IP of the slave off the socket once the slave
                      connects. Due to NAT and other routing issues, that IP
                      may not be valid for connecting to the slave from the
                      master or other hosts.
  --report-password=name 
                      Undocumented.
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If

                      if it can be read.
  --master-port=#     The port the master is listening on. If not set, the
                      compiled setting of MYSQL_PORT is assumed. If you have

                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-datbase updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.

                      want the slave to register itself with the master. Note
                      that it is not sufficient for the master to simply read
                      the IP of the slave off the socket once the slave
                      connects. Due to NAT and other routing issues, that IP
                      may not be valid for connecting to the slave from the
                      master or other hosts.

  --read_buffer_size=# 
                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value.
  --read_only         Make all tables readonly, with the exception for
                      replication (slave) threads and users with the SUPER
                      privilege
  --read_rnd_buffer_size=# 
                      When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows
                      are read through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks. If
                      not set, then it's set to the value of record_buffer.
  --record_buffer=#   Alias for read_buffer_size
  --relay_log_purge   0 = do not purge relay logs. 1 = purge them as soon as

  --slave_net_timeout=# 
                      Number of seconds to wait for more data from a
                      master/slave connection before aborting the read.
  --slave_transaction_retries=# 
                      Number of times the slave SQL thread will retry a
                      transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
                      lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping.
  --slow_launch_time=# 
                      If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
                      seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
                      incremented.
  --sort_buffer_size=# 
                      Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of
                      this size.
  --sync-binlog=#     Sync the binlog to disk after every #th event. #=0 (the
                      default) does no sync. Syncing slows MySQL down
  --sync-frm          Sync .frm to disk on create. Enabled by default
  --table_cache=#     The number of open tables for all threads.
  --thread_cache_size=# 
                      How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse.
  --thread_concurrency=# 
                      Permits the application to give the threads system a hint
                      for the desired number of threads that should be run at
                      the same time.
  --thread_stack=#    The stack size for each thread.
  --time_format=name  The TIME format (for future).
  --tmp_table_size=#  If an in-memory temporary table exceeds this size, MySQL
                      will automatically convert it to an on-disk MyISAM table.
  --transaction_alloc_block_size=# 
                      Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
                      binary log
  --transaction_prealloc_size=# 
                      Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
                      log
